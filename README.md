### Technologies:
PantryPal was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) in combination with Javascript, Redux, HTML, and CSS. The frontend and backend are nimbly constructed to store data in MongoDB while minimizing axios calls to our extensive recipe and ingredient API (spoonacularAPI) and our database, maximizing time efficiency and user experience.
